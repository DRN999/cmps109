CMPS 109 Lecture notes #2

recap:
Importance of Design building:
- Large programs, think less about functionality until you get the other things right
- architechture, outcome of the design
- modeling, large acceptance in engineering in general
- goes along with the concept of abstraction and decomposition
- UML, trying to describe the problem in a different perspective
- proving more perspective give more precise explanation of the problem, and discover all the problems/etc.
before writing the actual code

Software design methods:
- Notation, Process, Tools
- Tools ex. can go without spellcheck but spellcheck will make things much easier, reduce descrepancy within the design

The Object Model:
- Objects - Instance of a Class -> what describes an object -> object is a state
- entities that define things on its local states
- unifies the ideas of alorithmic and data abstraction - algorithmic design vs object-oriented design
- objects are the runime- the actual things that follows the class definitions

- Classes are the definitions


OO Software Development process:
- OO Analysis OOA: examine the problem
- OO Design OOD: create a solution for the problem
- OO Programming: THe development, the previous procedures will make the actual development much smoother
- if the design is done well, the development should be systimatic

Software life Cycle:
- Focus on the Second and Third:
- System and software design
- Implementation and Unit testing
