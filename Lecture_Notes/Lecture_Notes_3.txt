Declaration and Definition:
- Declare - the name the scope {}, call the fun : change the scope
if the variable is declared outside the scope, you need to specify if there is a variable with the
same name of the variable inside the scope.

C++ fundamentals
Function Call by value:
Primitive data type:
Composite/Complex Data types:
Bitwise operations:

BitFields

RTTI Run-Time Type Information:
how it works: The way to make the type dynamic at runtime
macro: typeId, return the name of the variable x;
- must delete object within heap or something
- print the same typeIDs with pointers
- things you can do at runtime

Staic variables:
- accecible anywhere, but only instantiated once

Malloc in c++:
- data allocation
- included in calloc
- similar to c# malloc

Valloc
- jumps the page boundary and gives a brand new memory
- its much easier to do bitwise operation with this and other memory moving type programs
